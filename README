#Diabetic Risk Prediction Using Retinal Data and Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning model that predicts the risk of diabetes by analyzing retinal (fundus) images. Diabetes can lead to Diabetic Retinopathy, a serious eye condition. By detecting early signs through retinal scans, this model aims to assist healthcare professionals in timely diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a computer vision-based solution that can automatically classify retinal images based on the presence and severity of diabetic indicators.

## 🗂️ Dataset

We used the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection** dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection). It contains high-resolution retinal images labeled according to the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

- **Classes:**
  - 0: No DR (Diabetic Retinopathy)
  - 1: Mild
  - 2: Moderate
  - 3: Severe
  - 4: Proliferative DR

- **Total Images**: ~3,660
- **Format**: JPEG
- **Label Source**: Certified ophthalmologists

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Libraries**: NumPy, OpenCV, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Model**: CNN-based architecture (e.g., EfficientNet / ResNet / custom CNN)
- **Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing and normalization
   - CLAHE for enhancing contrast
   - Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)

2. **Model Building**:
   - Transfer learning using pretrained CNN (EfficientNetB0)
   - Output layer with softmax activation (5 classes)

3. **Training**:
   - Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Epochs: 25–50 (early stopping applied)
   - Validation split: 20%

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - F1 Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve (optional)

## 📈 Results

- **Training Accuracy**: ~94%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~88%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~85%
- **Best Model**: EfficientNetB0 with fine-tuning and augmentation
- **Insights**:
  - Model performs well for early detection (class 0 and 1).
  - Slight misclassification in moderate and severe cases due to similar patterns.

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Learned to work with real-world medical image datasets.
- Gained hands-on experience with CNNs and transfer learning.
- Understood preprocessing techniques specific to retinal images.
- Recognized the importance of class balancing and augmentation in healthcare datasets.

## 🏁 Future Work

- Integrate Grad-CAM for visual explanation of model predictions.
- Optimize the model for edge deployment (mobile or web).
- Expand to multi-disease classification from retinal images.
